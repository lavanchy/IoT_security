# SmingRTOS libsecurity

This folder contains security related librarie implementations and sample projects.


### Support for the Atmel CryptoAuthentication devices and Libraries

Based on: Sming_RTOS Beta version
Based on: Espressif RTOS_SDK 1.4.0
Based on: Atmel CryptoAuthLib Firmware Library 20160108

Currently tested with ATECC508A device but should work with other devices as well

### Notes on library port

The library port is as less intrusiv as possible.
The main modifications are

-	Declare the required includes whee needed. 
	All includes refer files from the espressif SDK. Sming specif includes are only used when absolutly neccesary.
	
-	To get thing compiled it required one modification on the datastructures.
	More specific the naming the union on atca_iface.h (line 106)
	And obviously all references to it.

-	Added a esp8266 specific HAL imlpementation for I2C including specialzed Timers
	Other protocolls such as SPI, UART ore onewire are not yet implemented
	
-	The CryptoAuthLib is written in C so C++ classes witout specific extern "C" declrations cannot be used.
	This is the reason why the HAL imlementation is based on the two-wire I2C core imlementation in
	twi.h / core_esp8266_si2c.cpp as this is the only place within sming where i found the compatible "C" 
	function calls.
	
- 	finaly the port of the Atmel Node_Authetication sample has lot's of changes to improove memory hadling
	for RTOS. The Atmel code uses lots of huge (up to 1024 Bytes) display buffers to presset the test results.
	This is obviously forcing RTOS heap overflows. 
	Display output has bin replace with a HexDump utility that can nouw be found in the sming/services folder
	
### Building the samples

-	All security related code nucluding the samples are located in it's own folder within the sming folder
-	To build and use the security modules simply type make in the security folder
	This will create a library that will be linked against the application code
-	The samples work like an other samples just out of the folders where they are located

Note 

- 	building against rBoot is not yet support not tested. But it should work by simply modifiing the rBoot 
	Makefile (including the security lib)
	
### Required Hardware

-	Obviously the solution erquires an I2C ATECC508A cryptochip to work with
	The can be sourced from Atmel, Mouser or other source for less than 1$
	I recommend bying enough of those chips. Becaouse once the got personalized (provisioned with key
	material) they get locked and set to read only mode.
-	Brakout PCB
	I'm using "SMT BREAKOUT PCB FOR SOIC-8" from Adafrout to get the chips comaptible with breakout boards.
	Soldering them is easier as I initialy thought.
-	Other more expensife options are the "AT88CK101 Development Kit" from atmel that have a socket to hold the
	chip and connectors to wire them with the ESP 
	
### Configuring sample application

-	Check out the Node_Authetication app on how to init the Library

```cpp
ATCAIfaceCfg cfg_ateccx08a_i2c = {
		ATCA_I2C_IFACE, 	// active iface - how to interpret the union below
		ATECC508A, 			// explicit device type
		0xC0, 				// 8-bit slave address (I2C)
		1, 					// logical i2c bus number, 0-based - HAL will map this to a pin pair for SDA SCL
		200000, 			// baud rate i.e. I2C bus frequency - typically 400000
		800,				// wake_delay: microseconds of tWHI + tWLO which varies based on chip type
		20};				// the number of retries to attempt for receiving bytes
```		

-	The logical bus numbers i.e. the assigned GPIO pins are defined in in the HAL implementation -> hal_esp8266_i2c_RTOS.h

```cpp
#define MAX_I2C_BUSES 2

I2CBuses TWI_Bus[MAX_I2C_BUSES] = {{4, 5}, {0,2}};
```

### Using the Node_Authentication sample app

-	The samples should be executed in sequence as one command might initialize the context for the next command (e.g. create a calleng before the response and verifiing the response)
-	The client-provision will create the keys, stores them on the chip and lock the device to read only.
	This is a one time only process. However you can call the command multiple times but it will not modify
	data on the chip
-	The host-gen-chal call a RNG on the device. This number are not random until the device got provisioned
	A clean chip will create somthing like as random output
```
